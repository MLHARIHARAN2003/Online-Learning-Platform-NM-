## 2. Architecture
### Frontend
The frontend is built with **React**, following a component-based architecture that ensures modularity and reusability. Key features include:
- **React Router**: For single-page application (SPA) routing.
- **State Management**: Using React Context API for user session management.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop views using Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules.

### Backend
The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle RESTful APIs and business logic. Key features include:
- **Express Middleware**: For handling authentication, validation, and error handling.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens are used for user session management.
- **Data Validation**: Using express-validator to sanitize and validate input.

### Database
**MongoDB** is used as the primary database for storing users, courses, and enrollment details. Key collections include:
- **Users**: Stores user information, roles (student or educator), and authentication details.
- **Courses**: Stores course information, including sections, descriptions, and media content.
- **Enrollments**: Tracks which users are enrolled in which courses and their progress.
